### Description:
NUSpathfinder is a tool to list out all of the prerequisites and preclusions for a specific NUS course and specialisation/track so as to assist in module planning over the 4 years, because I worry too much. 

### Installation
To install all the dependencies required to run this app, run the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` on your 
Terminal/Command Prompt/Powershell Terminal. Make sure that you have navigated to the root directory (*nuspathfinder*)
of the app on your terminal.

### Usage
To start the CLI app, run the command `python main.py`. The CLI app interface should start up.
